**Project: CafeCRTL**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Overview**
CaféCTRL is a software engineering project for CS2113. The user interacts with the application through CLI. It has around 6 kLoC, and it is done in a team of 5.

## **Value Proposition**
CaféCRTL aims to optimize managing of inventory and cash flow in a restaurant. Our CLI platform empowers Café proprietors to streamline inventory and menu management.

## **Target User**
Café proprietors who prefer typing on CLI than any other interaction method and are seeking for a software solution to optimize the management of their café's operations.

### Enhancements implemented

#### Feature

1.  **Edit Price** <br>
    Function: Allow user to edit price of the dish on the menu
    Command Format: `edit_price dish/DISH_INDEX price/NEW_PRICE`<br>
    Error Handling: This command is able to detect missing argument tag, missing argument, wrong argument type, empty argument type and same price. It will then output specific error message to give user hint.
    <br/><br/>
   2.  **Help** <br>
       Function: Print out a list of commands and their usages to the user<br> 
       Extra info: This feature requires constant updating whenever a new feature is added. It is also very tedious to implement Junit test as the output is very long and keeps changing. Hence, I removed the Junit test in the last iteration as I feel that it is not necessary to have Junit test for a trivial `help` command.
   <br/><br/>
3.  **Encoding & Decoding of Pantry Stock Storage File** <br>
    Function: When the user calls bye command, all the ingredients stored in pantry will be encoded into format of `INGREDIENT_NAME | QUANTITY | UNIT`. The encoded data will be written in Pantry_stock.txt file. When the user starts a new session, the data in the text file will be extracted out and be decoded to load the ingredients back to PantryStock class.<br>
    Error Handling: This command will still check for the validity of each argument (e.g., length of ingredient name, type of unit), and skip the particular ingredient if any of the arguments is not valid. This can prevent the user from accidentally adding invalid ingredients to the text file.

### Enhancements
1. **Storage**<br>
   [Relevant PR](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-2/tp/pull/143) <br>
   - Read and learned from the storage system in addressbook level 3 and adopted it in our project.
   - Implemented `Encoding.java`, `Decoding.java` and `Storage.java` with skeleton methods for my teammates to implement. 
    <br><br>
2. **Parser**<br>
   Created `Parser.java` for other teammates to use. Implemented ParserUtil interface to reduce coupling of Parser.java and CafeCRTL.java.
   <br><br>
3. **Messages & ErrorMessages**<br>
   Created classes to store all messages to the user as static constant.
    <br><br>
4. **Parser Regex** <br>
   [Relevant PR](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113-T17-2/tp/pull/51) <br>
   - Learned `Pattern` and `Matcher` API by referring to addressbook and online documentations.
   - Created regex `COMMAND_ARGUMENT_FORMAT`, `ADD_ARGUMENT_STRING`, `LIST_INGREDIENT_ARGUMENT_STRING`, `DELETE_ARGUMENT_STRING` and `EDIT_PRICE_ARGUMENT_STRING`. 
   - Created a skeleton method body of `prepare_add` method using pattern and matcher, and added some basic explanations on how to use them for Dexter to follow and implement the feature.
